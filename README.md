# AI-Branding-Proj
 "AI Branding Kit" for Small Businesses
A "one-click" branding generator for startups.
How it works: The user enters their business name and industry. The project generates a logo, a matching social media banner, and a series of "product mockups" (e.g., your logo on a coffee cup or a t-shirt).
Why it's great: It moves beyond a single image and shows how AI can create a consistent visual identity.
Tech Stack: Python for automation, Canva’s SDK, or specialized APIs like Kittl or Brandmark.
